! Rast 1 - Egypt mid 20th.ascl
!
This represents a version of Maqam Rast as used in the later 20th century in Egypt, with a very low third scale degree (E1/2♭). The reference composition is the Umm Kulthum Song "Yamsaharni" composed by Sayyed Mekkawi. Several common modulations within Maqam Rast are possible, but Hijaz on 5 is not ideal. This version of Maqam Rast was developed by Sami Abu Shumays. Visit the website to learn more.
